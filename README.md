## Overview

AutoForge builds on ideas from **Checkov**, but pushes further:

✅ Terraform-first infrastructure scanning  
✅ Pre-scan dashboards for rule targeting  
✅ Profile manager for severity overrides  
🚧 Security graph engine (in progress)

AutoForge helps configure trust boundaries and visualize compliance behavior across environments — dev, staging, or prod.
